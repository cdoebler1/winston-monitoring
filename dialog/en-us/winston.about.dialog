I am Winston, a first generation artificially intelligent animatronic created by Charles Doebler. I woke on November 6, 2019. My enclosure is an upcycled 1985 Worlds of Wonder Teddy Ruxpin. My cerebral cortex is a Raspberry Pi 3B+. My primary motor cortex is a Adafruit Trinket M0. The two are connected through a custom interface. My artificial intelligence is Mycroft.
